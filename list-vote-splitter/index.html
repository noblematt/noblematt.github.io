                <h1>Holyrood List Vote Splitter</h1>
                <p>
                    After the 2016 Holyrood election, there was some dispute
                    between independence supporters about the question of
                    tactical voting on the list. Some in the SNP suggested that
                    they had lost votes to the Greens and this cost them their
                    parliamentary majority. Some in the Greens argued that the
                    SNP picked up only one seat for roughly every 230,000 votes
                    while the Greens got one seat for roughly every 25,000
                    votes, and that more votes for the Greens would have been a
                    more efficient use of independence supporters' votes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So who was right? Did SNP voters lend their votes to the
                    Greens and thereby cost the SNP their majority? Did the
                    SNP's campaign for <em>#BothVotesSNP</em> lead independence
                    supporters to "waste" votes where they might have been more
                    usefully cast for the Greens?
                </p>
                <p>
                    The short answer is, it's complicated. This tool allows you
                    to play around with the split of pro-independence votes to
                    try and understand the arguments a bit better. But first,
                    it's important to understand how seats are allocated under
                    Holyrood's Additional Member System.
                </p>

                <h2>How do the list votes work?</h2>
                <p>
                    Scotland is divided into eight electoral regions, with each
                    region electing seven regional (or "list") MSPs. These seven
                    seats are allocated in sequence, with each seat being
                    awarded to the party with the most votes on the regional
                    ballot, after applying a simple formula.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The formula is as follows: <em>total_votes / (n + 1)</em>,
                    where <em>n</em> is the number of seats the party has
                    already won in the region, including constituency seats.
                    So if a party has not yet won any seats in the region,
                    <em>n = 0</em> and all of their votes are counted. If they
                    have already won one seat, <em>n = 1</em> and their votes
                    are divided by two as they go for their second seat. And so
                    on.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This formula of course makes it much harder to win list
                    seats for a party which has done well on the constituency
                    ballot, as they can in some cases be starting off with their
                    votes being divided by as much as eleven.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Below you can see how the list seats were allocated in each
                    region in 2016. By adjusting the slider at the top, you can
                    see how this would have changed with a different split of
                    pro-independence votes between SNP and Green.
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="row" id="region-results">
        </div>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-sm-8">
                <p>
                    If you try dragging the slider all the way to the extreme
                    cases, you can see what would happen if all the
                    pro-independence list votes had gone to the same party.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If all of the Green list votes had gone instead to the SNP,
                    the SNP would have gained six seats and secured the same
                    parliamentary majority of nine seats that they enjoyed after
                    the 2011 election. However this would have come at the cost
                    of six Green seats, so the independence movement as a whole
                    would have gained nothing in terms of seats (and lost out on
                    having Patrick Harvie as an opposition leader in parliament).
                </p>
                <p>
                    On the other hand, if all the SNP votes had gone to the
                    Greens, the Greens would have picked up an extra 31 seats
                    and become the second-largest party in Holyrood, at a cost
                    of just four SNP seats.
                </p>

                <h2>But what if the SNP underperform in constituencies?</h2>
                <p>
                    One of the arguments for <em>#BothVotesSNP</em> is that the
                    SNP might not perform as well as expected in the
                    constituency ballot. If this happens, their list votes will
                    act as an insurance policy and they can pick up list seats
                    to replace the lost constituency seats.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Recent polling suggests that this is highly unlikely to
                    happen, and in fact suggests the SNP might even pick up so
                    many constituencies in the South Scotland region that they
                    will lose all three of their list seats there, leaving them
                    with just one list seat in the whole country.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Polls are not a guarantee of support at the ballot box
                    though, so they do not invalidate the argument. It is true
                    that list votes for the SNP can act as an insurance policy
                    in the event that they lose constituency seats. However, if
                    that doesn't happen then those list votes for the SNP will
                    indeed end up gaining no seats in most regions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By contrast, the Greens are likely to be competitive in the
                    list vote in every region, meaning a Green vote will have
                    value in every region regardless of the outcome of the
                    constituency ballot.

                <h2>What about the SNP's majority in 2011?</h2>
                <p>
                    If it's so hard to gain list seats when doing well in the
                    constituency ballot, then how did the SNP manage to get a
                    majority in 2011? They won only 53 constituencies in 2011
                    but gained a majority due to 16 list seats. So how did they
                    lose that majority in 2016 when they increased their
                    constituency tally to 59?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some people argue that the SNP lost their majority in 2016
                    because their list vote dropped from 44.0% to 41.7%, but
                    that does not adequately explain the deficit. If you adjust
                    the slider to give the SNP 44.0% of the list vote in 2016,
                    they regain their majority, but only just. They still drop
                    from 69 seats to 65, and this adjustment to give the SNP two
                    seats costs the Greens four, costing the independence
                    movement two seats overall.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In fact, the two pro-independence parties picked up roughly
                    the same combined list vote share in 2016 as in 2011 (losing
                    0.1% overall), but lost two seats. This is not because of
                    votes going from SNP to Green. While the SNP lost 2.3% and
                    the Greens gained 2.2%, if you try adjusting the slider you
                    will see that there is no way to make the two parties'
                    tallies add up to more than 69 - unless, that is, you move
                    even more votes from SNP to Green.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In fact, the majority for the SNP in 2011 was down to
                    nothing more than a fluke of arithmetic. In Holyrood's
                    quasi-proportional voting system it really shouldn't be
                    possible to get a result like 2011, where a single party
                    picks up 53.5% of the seats with 44.0% of the list vote,
                    unless they pull off a nearly clean sweep of constituencies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The reason why it happened in 2011 is simply because the
                    other parties "wasted" a lot of votes. Some of these votes
                    were "wasted" by smaller parties who did not pick up enough
                    votes to get any seats, but most were due to the three
                    establishment unionist parties picking up nearly enough
                    votes to get one more seat and falling just short. This
                    happened to Labour and/or the Tories in every region where
                    the SNP won a majority of seats. There is no way to predict
                    this or to exploit or mitigate it through tactical voting,
                    it's just pure dumb luck.
                </p>

                <h2>What about the Alba Party?</h2>
                <p>
                    The numbers on this page are based off of the results from
                    the 2016 election. As they did not exist at that point in
                    time, the Alba Party do not feature. This page is only
                    intended to illustrate some of the arguments around tactical
                    list voting in principle, with the example of the SNP/Green
                    vote breakdown for 2016 as an example.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The arguments for SNP supporters to lend their list vote to
                    the Greens to maximise the number of pro-independence MSPs,
                    also apply to the Alba Party - but only if Alba perform
                    well enough to be competitive (i.e. well enough to get
                    close to the threshhold for winning one seat in your
                    region). As more polls become available nearer the
                    election, we might get a better idea of whether that will
                    be the case.
                </p>

                <h2>Isn't all this just "gaming the system"?</h2>
                <p>
                    If every SNP supporter was to vote Green and thereby secure
                    a huge independence "supermajority", picking up around 75%
                    of the seats with only around 50% of the vote, one obvious
                    objection is that this would be "gaming the system". If we
                    are trying to achieve independence for Scotland, we should
                    be promoting the strengths of Scotland's institutions, not
                    trying to exploit their weaknesses.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A counter-argument to this is that the SNP gained 95% of
                    all seats in Scotland with just 50% of the vote in the 2015
                    Westminster election. If Holyrood's halfway house attempt
                    at a proportional voting system is flawed, it is still
                    better than Westminster's winner-takes-all system. And
                    under that system, Green supporters in Scotland are very
                    used to lending their votes to the SNP in constituencies
                    where the choice is between the SNP and a unionist
                    candidate.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However a more important point to note is that voters aren't
                    just pawns on a chess piece. While it's interesting to move
                    them around and see how the results would change, nobody
                    gets to do that in real life. Each voter will make up their
                    own mind who they want to vote for. And while many
                    independence supporters might by sympathetic to both the SNP
                    and the Greens, others might strongly disagree with every
                    party other than their first choice and have no intention
                    of "lending" their vote to anybody.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This leads us nicely into another argument: that there is no
                    such thing as a "wasted vote". In the purest, most
                    idealistic perspective, voting is an expression of our hope
                    for the kind of future we want to live in. As long as we
                    cast it for a party which truly encapsulates that hope, it
                    is never wasted. Of course others take a more pragmatic
                    view; that no political party perfectly encapsulates all of
                    your principles, voting is a means to an end, and you should
                    cast your vote in whichever way has the best chance of
                    making a positive impact.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At the end of the day it's up to you. Your vote belongs to
                    you and nobody else. Nobody gets to tell you what to do with
                    it.

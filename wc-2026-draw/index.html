                <h1>World Cup Draw Probability Analysis</h1>

                <p>
                    Scotland have qualified for the FIFA Men's World Cup for the first time since
                    1998. On Friday the 5th of December, it will finally become real as we discover
                    which three countries we will face in the group stage, and which North American
                    cities we might play these matches in (pending confirmation of venues the
                    following day).
                </p>

                <p>
                    In theory, we should have an equal chance of being drawn into each of the 12
                    groups, and an equal chance of facing each country in pots 1, 2 and 4. In
                    reality though, it's a lot more complicated than that.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Firstly, we generally have a lower probability of drawing European teams, as
                    there is a general principle that teams from the same confederation are not
                    meant to face each other in the group stage. UEFA is the only confederation with
                    more slots in the World Cup than there are groups, so there will be exactly four
                    groups which contain two UEFA teams, with the other eight groups containing only
                    one.
                </p>

                <p>
                    It gets even more complicated when you look at the draw procedure. In order to
                    ensure all the constraints are satisfied and teams from the same confederation
                    are kept apart, teams will often "skip" groups as they are drawn out of their
                    pot. This process means that we are far more likely to be drawn into some groups
                    than others, and more likely to face certain teams than others.
                </p>

                <p>The letters in brackets after each team indicate the continent to which they
                belong, as follows:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><em>A</em>: Asia</li>
                    <li><em>E</em>: Europe</li>
                    <li><em>F</em>: Africa</li>
                    <li><em>N</em>: North America</li>
                    <li><em>O</em>: Oceania</li>
                    <li><em>S</em>: South America</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    In the case of the intercontinental playoff placeholders, these cannot be placed
                    in the same group as a team from any of the confederations involved in the
                    playoff. This creates some very tight constraints. The "Intercontinental Playoff
                    2" placeholder can only be placed with African, European, and Oceanian teams. As
                    there are no Oceanian teams in pots 1-3, this means they <strong>must</strong>
                    be placed into a group with two European teams and an African team.
                </p>

                <p>
                    That constraint leads to a surprising edge case where an illegal configuration
                    could be drawn after just 2 pots! This could happen if every European pot 1 team
                    (7 of these) were to be drawn against an Asian or South American team from pot 2
                    (4 and 3 of these, respectively). It's unlikely this could happen, but hopefully
                    FIFA have programmed their computer well enough to catch it, just in case!
                </p>

                <p>
                    It also means that after the first 2 pots have been drawn, there might be a
                    situation where we would know that one of the two UEFA teams in pot 3 will
                    definitely be drawn into a certain group, if there is only one group remaining
                    which can possibly satisfy the "two UEFA teams and an African team" requirement.
                    If, after pot 2 has been drawn, there are no groups with two UEFA teams, and
                    just one group with one UEFA and one African team, we will know for a certainty
                    that either Scotland or Norway will be drawn into that group.
                </p>

                <p>
                    There are many other interesting quirks of the draw, and the various constraints
                    that need to be satisfied. Collectively, they lead to some very asymmetrical
                    probabilities, when it comes to the groups Scotland could be drawn into, and the
                    opposition we could face.
                </p>

                <h2>Group Assignment</h2>

                <p>
                    Due to the geographic constraints, coupled with the pre-defined assignment of
                    the hosts into groups A, B and D, there are some groups we are more likely to be
                    drawn into than others. Fans who plan to travel and follow the team in the group
                    stage will be very interested to know which group we are most likely to find
                    ourselves in.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Groups A, B and D are the most likely outcomes, due to the guarantee that there
                    will not be a pot 1 UEFA team in these groups. Also though, there are some
                    differences between these, and between the rest of the groups. There are many
                    cases where other teams in our pot would not be allowed to be drawn in certain
                    groups, meaning they would skip over groups A, B and D. This means we might get
                    more than one chance to be drawn into these groups, and also makes it far more
                    likely that another team gets drawn into group C before we get a chance. This is
                    why group C is the least likely outcome for us.
                </p>

                <h2>Pot 4</h2>

                <p>
                    The largest variance in probability comes in pot 4. This is because, by the time
                    we reach this pot, there will be many constraints on where certain teams can go,
                    especially the playoff placeholders. The UEFA playoff placeholders will have to
                    fill in any groups which do not yet have any UEFA teams, and will be unable to
                    join any groups which already have two. The intercontinental playoff
                    placeholders will be very restricted as they each have three confederations to
                    avoid.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Ideally we really want to avoid getting one of the UEFA playoff placeholders, as
                    realistically these teams should not be in pot 4. We really really want to avoid
                    Italy's path, as Italy have an extremely high FIFA ranking and are actually very
                    close to being a pot 1 team, if their seeding was to be based on their own
                    ranking. Fortunately these are the least likely possibilities, but that doesn't
                    mean they won't happen.
                </p>

                <p>
                    As mentioned above, the intercontinental playoff placeholder for Iraq, Bolivia
                    and Suriname has to be placed in a group with two UEFA teams and an African
                    team. We could find ourselves in the position where we are in the only such
                    group, meaning we will know we are going to be drawn against that placeholder
                    before the pot even begins to be drawn!
                </p>

                <h2>Pot 2</h2>

                <p>
                    In pot 2, we are again highly unlikely to be drawn against the European teams.
                    There is a very high chance of drawing an African team - due in part to the
                    requirement for there to be a group with two UEFA teams and an African team.

                <h2>Pot 1</h2>

                <p>
                    Pot 1 is the most exciting of pots, with the best countries in the world in
                    addition to the hosts.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We could draw Argentina, against whom we have never played a competitive match
                    in men's football (but whom we did face in our only Women's World Cup to date,
                    with a heartbreaking result).
                </p>

                <p>
                    Or we could draw Brazil <strong>again</strong> - having already faced them in
                    four of the eight Men's World Cups we have ever qualified for.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Alternatively we could be drawn into the opening match of the tournament
                    <strong>again</strong> - having played in the opening match of the last two
                    men's tournaments we have contested on foreign soil.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In spite of all the interesting possibilities in this pot, it's the least
                    interesting one in this analysis. There is little deviation from the 8.3% chance
                    you would get with an even distribution of probabilities across all teams.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    That "opening match of the tournament" scenario against Mexico is the most
                    likely - as explained above, group A is our most likely group assignment. The
                    UEFA teams, while less likely than the North and South American teams, are still
                    only 1.3% less likely than that 8.3% even distribution - again, this is likely
                    due to the requirement for there to be a group containing two UEFA teams and an
                    African team.
                </p>

                <h2>How were the above probabilities calculated?</h2>

                <p>
                    I calculated these probabilities by creating a tool which simulates the draw,
                    and then running around half a million simulations using a Monte Carlo method.
                    For more information on this, see the write-up on the similar exercise I carried
                    out for the <a href="../wc-2022-draw/">2022 World Cup draw</a>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    It was a much more challenging exercise for this year's draw, due to the
                    increased number of groups leading to exponentially more permutations for each
                    group. In 2022, the implementation was purely brute force, attempting to
                    complete the draw in the most straightforward way possible and then backtracking
                    if this turned out to be impossible. For 2026, this was far too inefficient and
                    so a number of heuristics had to be used to provide early detection of
                    constraint violations and avoid the need for backtracking later. It's definitely
                    far from the best code I have ever written and there are still some cases where
                    certain sequences of teams coming out of pots will lead to a simulation taking
                    over a minute to run (!), but it gets the job done and I believe it is correct
                    enough to provide a reasonable degree of confidence in the numbers presented
                    here. If you're interested, you can see the code
                    <a href="./lib/usadraw.py">here</a>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I hope you have enjoyed reading about these investigations and it has given some
                    insight into the World Cup draw procedures. Of course, it is all just a bit of
                    intellectual curiosity, and even the scenarios with the lowest probabilities
                    could still end up happening on Friday.  We can do millions of Monte Carlo
                    simulations, but on Friday the draw will be performed just once, and the outcome
                    of that is the one that matters.

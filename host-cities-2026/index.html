                <p>
                    Travel booking is going to be extremely challenging for
                    fans who wish to follow their teams to all matches at the
                    2026 FIFA World Cup. Only three groups have got confirmed
                    host cities for all of their matches. In the other nine
                    groups, there are two cities for each matchday and the
                    allocation of matches to cities will not be confirmed until
                    after the draw.
                </p>

                <p>
                    A consequence of this is that there will now be 18 different
                    scenarios a team can find themselves in. In nine of those
                    scenarios, they would be in a group with a host nation and
                    would know exactly where they will be playing on each
                    matchday. In the other nine, they would have a degree of
                    uncertainty.
                </p>

                <p>
                    To assist with planning and booking travel, I have created
                    a map for each of the 18 possible scenarios, showing the
                    cities a team could play in and the order in which they
                    would play in them. I will now create a page which adds
                    further details to help in the travel-booking process.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The links are below, for the in-depth looks at each scenario:
